# eee-ticket-maker

Produces a n*2-page PDF of alternating front/back EEE tickets with the ticket numbers automatically populated using the font in `font.ttf`. It creates a PDF in this way because that's the format that Zapcopy accepts for printing.

## Usage

`python3 number.py` or `python3 number.py <n>` where `n` is the number of tickets to put in the PDF.
